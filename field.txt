You awake in a field covered in sunlight. You can't remember how you got here, but you know you need to find your way back home.
All you currently have is the clothes on your back. It may be a good idea to learn some new skills. 
You never know what you may encounter during your travels!
While in the field, you can view your stats by typing STATS. Please select bold options from choices listed at each location. Have fun!
