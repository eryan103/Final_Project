You awake in a field covered in sunlight. You can't remember how you got here, but you know you need to find your way back home.
All you currently have is the clothes on your back. It may be a good idea to stock up on healing items as well as learn some
skills. You never know what you may encounter during your travels!
While in the field, you can access your inventory by typing INV and your stats by typing STATS.
